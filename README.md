**All the SCRIPTS that I put here are not "EXPLOITS" they are scripts that you can use in Roblox Studio, or both in allowed executors!.(Use with caution)**

_Hello, today I will show you all the scripts, but without the source code, only using "Loadstring" which is easier to execute in executors allowed by Roblox. Each script will have its name, if you want to access the source code, it's in this repository. Byeüëç_

# Fly Script
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/batatacodes/RobloxScripts/refs/heads/main/roblox_fly_script.lua"))()
```
# noclip Windows
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/batatacodes/RobloxScripts/refs/heads/main/roblox_noclip_window_script.lua"))()
```
# SpeedBoost
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/batatacodes/RobloxScripts/refs/heads/main/roblox_speed_boost_script.lua"))()
```
# ESP label
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/batatacodes/RobloxScripts/refs/heads/main/roblox_esp_script.lua"))()
```

remembering, none of my Solo scripts are obfuscated! They are all Source Codes that you want to modify at your own risk.
